Are you considering using ‘IOT’ (the Internet of Things) in your business ? If so, you may be interested in learning more about big data.

Big data is a term used to describe the growing amount of data that’s being processed and analyzed. Devices are collecting more information than ever before and businesses are starting to take advantage of this wealth of data. 

While IOT is generating data, big data can be used for a number of purposes, including product development, marketing, and forecasting.

To take full advantage of big data for IOT, you need to understand how it works and what tools are available to help you use it effectively. In this article, we’ll share use cases, real-world applications, methods and tools, issues and concerns associated with those two technologies.

Our presentation is divided into six key sections. We will first define [the terms IoT and Big Data](/pages/definitions-big-data-et-iot.md) before presenting [real-world applications](/pages/cas-dusages.md) of both. Then, we'll discuss [approaches and tools for managing Big Data and IoT](/pages/approches-et-outils.md) as well as [problems and challenges associated](/pages/enjeux-et-defis.md) with those two technologies. Finally, we will present [some applications of AI in Big Data and IoT](/pages/applications-de-ia.md) before introducing [perspectives of Big Data and IoT](/pages/perspectives-futures.md).
